# Physics-Constrained-Transformer-for-Cyclone-Trajectory-and-Damage-Prediction
This framework fuses satellite imagery, atmospheric data, and terrain information with a physics-constrained transformer to predict cyclone trajectories. By integrating hazard models and scenario simulations, it delivers interpretable, physically grounded forecasts of cyclone impacts.
